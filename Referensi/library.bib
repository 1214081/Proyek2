   abstract = {A year after the COVID-19 pandemic took place, activities that were carried out online gradually switched back to face-to-face. This has caused controversy given the high transmission. Therefore, this study aims to analyze public sentiment by utilizing Twitter data. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was also conducted in this study to classify public opinion. It was found that face-to-face learning was the highlight of public conversation and was dominated by negative sentiment, followed by neutral and positive sentiment. Meanwhile, the LDA model produced topics about vaccination, public preference, school reopening, public sentiment, studentsâ€™ longing for face-to-face learning and face-to-face learning plan.},
